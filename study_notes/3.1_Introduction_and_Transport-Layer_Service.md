## 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services

A transport-layer protocol provides for **logical communication** between application processes running on different hosts. Processes can use it without considering the details of connection.

It will convert the messages into transport-layer packets by breaking them into several chunks and add headers.

### 3.1.1 Relationship Between Transport and Network Layers

Transport-layer protocol is analogy to Ann and Bill who collect and distribute the letter to each kid. The network-layer protocol is analogy to postal service.

### 3.1.2 Overview of the Transport Layer in the Internet

- **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)

  connectionless, best-effort service

- **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)

  reliable, flow-and congestion-controlled connection-oriented transport 

IP is said to be an **unreliable service**, but TCP could convert it to a reliable data transport service. 

Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process is called **transport-layer multiplexing** and **demultiplexing**
