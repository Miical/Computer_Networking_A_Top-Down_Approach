# CHAPTER 7: Wireless and Mobile Networks

## 7.1 Introduction

- **Single-hop, infrastructure-based.** 802.11 networks,  caf√©, of library; and the 4G LTE data networks.
- Single-hop, infrastructure-less. Bluetooth networks.
- Multi-hop, infrastructure-based.  **wireless mesh**
- Multi-hop, infrastructure-less. 



## 7.2 Wireless Links and Network Characteristics

This host receives an electromagnetic signal that is a combination of a degraded form of the original signal transmitted by the sender and background noise in the environment. The **signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)** is a relative measure of the strength of the received signal and this noise. 

...

- For a given modulation scheme. the higher the SNR, the lower the BER. 



### 7.2.1 CDMA

In a CDMA protocol, each bit being sent is encoded by multiplying the bit by a signal that changes at a much faster rate (known as the **chipping rate**) than the original sequence data bits.
